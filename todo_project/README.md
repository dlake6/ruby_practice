This project built on our knowledge of Ruby class and instance variables.  I used a class variable to store my todos and a before :each tag in my spec file to allow robust testing.  I also experimented with named parameters as a method for searching through these items, either by a string contained within the title or by the exact title.

It is tested using RSpec.
