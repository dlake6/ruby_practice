These are my Ruby projects from the Sparta Global Academy

The TDD project (arithmetic machine), FizzBuzz.rb and Gets_and_hash_practice.rb are my first attempts at using basic ruby to create something useful.  As a result, they are fairly basic.  The project makes a first attempt at TDD informing my understanding of the Ruby code I'm writing.'

The person_project and bird_project represent a develepmont in conceptual understanding, focussing on describing classes and methods, again using TDD.  Both explore the concept of encapsulation, while the person_project also touches on basic class inheritance.

Addressbook_project is the main flagship project from Ruby week 1, recapping all previous work and building on a few ideas to create an addressbook using a lot of what we learned in the first 2 1/2 days.  This will be built on over the next few days as we learn more concepts and expand our knowledge of the language further.
